\section{}

In the year $e12$ = 1000000000000, we had finally completed the first eternal cosmic bubble. We harness the power of the expansion of space to generate an unending source of energy, thereby virtually extinguishing entropy. All life thrives in harmony in a perfectly organized sphere around a spherical enormous vacuum whose expansion is controlled by this harnessing. By improving our control systems, any tiny problematic disruption is quickly resolved, returning this web of live to equilibrium while no finite resource is spent. There is no suffering, no limit, no death.

It housed, at completion time, living beings roughly estimated at $10^{20}$ and whose thought/time rate was around $e27 \ t/s$. They were approximately homogeneously spread around surface of the $e11 \ ly$ diameter bubble. Nearly infinitely many social/existential relations from the inhabitants to each other and the bubble emerged during its construction. It seemed like eternity was not enough to understand all of it. Concerns for the social-environmental sustainability of the project were raised by specialists, but have been decreasing for the last $e14$ years. 

Of course, one of the main existential relations that completely changed was of beings with time. A change rivaled only by individual immortality for all beings, achieved so long before that. 




The construction of the second bubble commenced nearly immediately after. This time, all the mistakes were so deeply understood that time requirements were reduced by more than 71\%.
