Glossary:

Aggregate: The total (conceived as greater than the sum of its parts) emergential behavior of a system.
Central Core: Largest production structured situated on the northern and sourthern parts of the sun. It uses the optimal OPT-SOL mist system of nano texnoplantae for energy absorption, 
Empirical: Perceivable by the sense-apparatus of the texnorganical aggregate.
Full-Communion: A situation when all Texno, Organic and Psi-empirical beings are in a radically egalitarian society in which freedom, justice, community are never broken, all necessities are easily met .
Sol Community: The name of the society composed of OPT Psixie.
Solarians: OPT inhabitants of the Sol Community.
Psi-Empirical: Perceivable by a the psixe.
Psixe: A mind-possessing entity, either Organic, Psi-empiric or texnological.
Psixie: Plural of Psixe
Psixia: The Aggregate of a community os Psixie
Psixium: The substance of Psixe (Largely still a mystery).
Texnic psixe: 



Intro: After many wars, enslavements, social fights, the humans, technological beings, psi-empirical beings and organic psixie finally achieved Full Communion in 32193, which allowed for the beginning of the optmization era. Extremely high levels of concord with the Triple L paradigm of the Sol Community, the absence of the Tyranny of Upkeep, and the

Section 1. Historical Stigmata of Post-Neptun

The Psixie of Post-Neptun have always faced non-optimal energy dynamics which has lead to a problematic texnorganical economy. The distance from the sun makes the best energy generator possessed by solarians, the OPT-SOL mist, next-to useless, while the total absence of geothermal energy disables all associated energy generation methods. The main energy source are therefore fusion as well as the inflow from the the Central Core.   The Sol Community achieved nigh-optimal energy delivery levels levels in 34995,
